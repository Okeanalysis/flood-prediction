# flood-prediction
Flood Prediction Project
This repository contains the code and data for the Flood Prediction project submitted to the Kaggle competition: Playground Series Season 4, Episode 5.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of floods using the provided dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using the R2 score.

File Descriptions
flood.py: The main script that trains the model and makes predictions on the test data.

submission.csv: The output file containing the predictions on the test data.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Installation

Data
Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page: Playground Series Season 4, Episode 5

Place the downloaded files in a directory named data within the project folder:

kotlin
Copy code
flood-prediction/
│
├── data/
│   ├── train.csv
│   ├── test.csv
│
├── flood.py
├── submission.csv
└── README.md
Usage
To train the model and generate predictions, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python flood.py
This will output the predictions to submission.csv.

Submission
To submit the results to Kaggle:

Navigate to the submission page of the competition.
Upload the submission.csv file.
Results
After running the script, the submission.csv will contain the predictions for the test data. You can submit this file to Kaggle to see how your model performs.
